# Hi, we're Anthrax and Naudile!

Blast Labs is a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO) for pseudonymous hackers, artists, and builders to experiment with crypto tools and protocols.  

We're creative technologists who have built fintech startups, created IRL and digital art, and managed massive machine learning systems.  We believe crypto is the start of a new world of fat, global, decentralized protocols and apps run by egalitarian communities of builders and nomads.  Bitcoin and Ethereum are just the early start of this lit new world, and we are the fastest and wildest prototypers of what that could be.

We created Blast Labs as a totally remote and distributed digital collective.  We invite people who make stuff to join and collaborate on projects.  We are looking for: digital artists, Solidity programmers, meme queens, social media stars, full stack coders (C#, C++, Java, Javascript, Lua, Python), and designers to help on current and future projects.  If you want to join, fill this out.

### We can be reached via Twitter or email.
